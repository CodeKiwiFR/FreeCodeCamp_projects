                Vegetables are parts of plants that are consumed by humans or other 
                animals as food. The original meaning is still commonly used and is 
                applied to plants collectively to refer to all edible plant matter, 
                including the flowers, fruits, stems, leaves, roots, and seeds. The 
                alternate definition of the term is applied somewhat arbitrarily, 
                often by culinary and cultural tradition. It may exclude foods 
                derived from some plants that are fruits, flowers, nuts, and cereal 
                grains, but include savoury fruits such as tomatoes and courgettes, 
                flowers such as broccoli, and seeds such as pulses.<br>
                Originally, vegetables were collected from the wild by 
                hunter-gatherers and entered cultivation in several parts of the 
                world, probably during the period 10,000 BC to 7,000 BC, when a 
                new agricultural way of life developed.<br>
                At first, plants which 
                grew locally would have been cultivated, but as time went on, 
                trade brought exotic crops from elsewhere to add to domestic 
                types. Nowadays, most vegetables are grown all over the world 
                as climate permits, and crops may be cultivated in protected 
                environments in less suitable locations.<br>
                China is the largest producer of vegetables, and global trade in 
                agricultural products allows consumers to purchase vegetables grown in 
                faraway countries. The scale of production varies from subsistence 
                farmers supplying the needs of their family for food, to 
                agribusinesses with vast acreages of single-product crops. Depending 
                on the type of vegetable concerned, harvesting the crop is followed 
                by grading, storing, processing, and marketing.<br>
                Vegetables can be eaten either raw or cooked and play an important 
                role in human nutrition, being mostly low in fat and carbohydrates, 
                but high in vitamins, minerals and dietary fiber. Many nutritionists 
                encourage people to consume plenty of fruit and vegetables, five or 
                more portions a day often being recommended.
